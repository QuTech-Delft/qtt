### Code style

* Try to follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. Many editors support [autopep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8) that can help with coding style.
 To allow longer lines, make a `.pep8` config file like:
 ```
[pep8]
max-line-length = 120
```
* Document your functions
* For more guidelines see the Qcodes documentation

### Uploading code

To upload code use `git commit` and `git push`. For the `Qcodes` and `qtt` repositories always make a branch first.
After uploading a branch one can make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the `dev` branch 
which will be reviewed for inclusion in QTT.


### Bugs reports and feature requests

This is what github's [issues](https://github.com/VandersypenQutech/qtt/issues) are for. Search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not yet addressed, please open a new issue.
