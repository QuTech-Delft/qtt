# Summary

The QuTech Tuning package (qtt) is a software package containing measurement routines and analysis functions 
for the tuning and calibration of spin-qubits. An introduction to spin-qubits can be found~[@LievenSpins].

The package is organized in the following subpackages:

* Measurements
* Algorithms
* Utilities
* Gui
* Instrument Drivers

bla bla bla

Conventions: qcodes Dataset, return arguments are dicts, etc.

The methods from this paper have been used in the following papers: [@Baart2016], [@Diepen2018].
