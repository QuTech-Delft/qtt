Code style
----------

Because QTT is a framework used by many people, we need it to follow certain style guidelines. Because, as
the PEP 8 documentation says: "One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written.
The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide
spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts"."

We try to follow the `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guide except that we allow lines to be up to 120 characters.
Many editors support `autopep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8>`_ that can help with coding style. Below we list some basic coding style guidelines, including examples. Please follow them when contributing to QTT.



* Docstrings are required for classes, attributes, methods, and functions (if public i.e no leading underscore).

* Document your functions before making a Pull request into QTT. An example of a well documented function is shown below:

  .. code:: python


		def _cost_double_gaussian(signal_amp, counts, params):
			""" Cost function for fitting of double Gaussian. 

			Args:
				signal_amp (array): x values of the data
				counts (array): y values of the data
				params (array): parameters of the two gaussians, [A_dn, A_up, sigma_dn, sigma_up, mean_dn, mean_up]
					amplitude of first (second) gaussian = A_dn (A_up) 
					standard deviation of first (second) gaussian = sigma_dn (sigma_up)
					average value of the first (second) gaussian = mean_dn (mean_up)

			Returns:
				cost (float): value which indicates the difference between the data and the fit

			"""
			model = double_gaussian(signal_amp, params)
			cost = np.linalg.norm(counts - model)

			return cost

	
* Since we are dealing with code in development:

   - For methods implementing an algorithm return a dictionary so that we can modify the output arguments without breaking backwards compatibility
   - Add arguments ``fig`` or ``verbose`` to function to provide flexible analysis and debugging

Uploading code
--------------

To upload code use git commit and git push. For the qtt repository always make a branch first. After
uploading a branch one can make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) which will be reviewed for inclusion in QTT.



Bugs reports and feature requests
---------------------------------

This is what githubâ€™s `issues <https://github.com/VandersypenQutech/qtt/issues>`_ are for. Search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not yet addressed, please open a new issue.
