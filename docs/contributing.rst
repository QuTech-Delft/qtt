Code style
----------

* Docstrings are required for classes, attributes, methods, and functions (if public i.e no leading underscore).
* Try to follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. Many editors support [autopep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8) that can help with coding style.

Uploading code
--------------

To upload code use git commit and git push. For the qtt repository always make a branch first. After uploading a branch one can make a (pull request)[https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/] which will be reviewed for inclusion in QTT.

Bugs reports and feature requests
---------------------------------

This is what githubâ€™s [issues](https://github.com/VandersypenQutech/qtt/issues) are for. Search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not yet addressed, please open a new issue.
