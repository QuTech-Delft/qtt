Code style
----------

* Docstrings are required for classes, attributes, methods, and functions (if public i.e no leading underscore).
* Try to follow the `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guide. Many editors support `autopep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8>`_ that can help with coding style.
* Since we are dealing with code in development:
   - For methods implementing an algorithm return a dictionary so that we can modify the output arguments without breaking backwards compatibility
   - Add arguments ``fig`` or ``verbose`` to function to provide flexible analysis and debugging

Uploading code
--------------

To upload code use git commit and git push. For the qtt repository always make a branch first. After
uploading a branch one can make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) which will be reviewed for inclusion in QTT.

Bugs reports and feature requests
---------------------------------

This is what githubâ€™s `issues <https://github.com/VandersypenQutech/qtt/issues>`_ are for. Search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not yet addressed, please open a new issue.
